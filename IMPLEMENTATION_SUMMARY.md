---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Account Type Selection During Signup**
- **File**: `lib/screens/auth/account_type_selection_screen.dart` (NEW)
- **Changes**: 
  - Created account type selection screen with two options:
    - **Normal User**: Explore cafes, submit shops, write reviews
    - **Business Account**: Manage cafes, post events, list jobs
  - Updated `signup_screen.dart` to accept `accountType` parameter
  - Added `accountType` field to Firestore user document

### 2. **Separate User Experience**

#### **Normal User Account**
- **Can submit shops** but only view submission status (pending/approved)
- **Cannot manage shops** - shows dialog with shop status instead
- **No access to business dashboard** - only contribution features
- **Profile shows**: "Contribute to Community" section
- **Submission states**:
  - ✅ "Submission Approved" (green) - shop is live
  - ⏳ "Submission Pending" (orange) - under review
  - ➕ "Submit A Shop" - no submission yet

#### **Business Account**
- **Full shop management access** after verification
- **Can claim existing shops** or submit new ones
- **Access to Business Dashboard** with:
  - Analytics & Stats (ratings, visits, saves, reviews)

### 4. **Shop Claiming System**
- **ClaimShopScreen**: Search interface for finding unclaimed shops

### 6. **Updated Profile Tab**
- **File**: `lib/screens/tabs/profile_tab.dart` (UPDATED)
- **Dynamic UI** based on `accountType`:

  - Renders `_buildUserContributeSection()` for normal users
